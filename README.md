# Web-Chat_Using_WebSocket
We are going to develop a chat application using Express, WebSocket. I using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around WebSocket, its super easy to use and provides a fallback to xhr requests until the WebSocket connection is established. The frontend-UI is based on Flexbox so you can modify it as per your liking.
